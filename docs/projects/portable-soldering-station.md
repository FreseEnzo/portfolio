# Portable Soldering Station

## Brainstorming 31/10/2024
1) I want something portable and small;
2) I want also some kind of modulatity, like I'm tring to do with the Buck Booster;
3) Maybe with a central battery that can share voltage to all my modular projects;
4) Circular screen to the temperature control;
